This provides something to suit the different styles of the athletes, who scope out their lines and aim for what could earn a podium finish. In the back of their minds is the cut, which means for many, this would be their last FWT event of the season, and so they have nothing to lose to stay on tour and earn their place in the FWT Finals.</desc></programme>

But this isn’t about winter blues or summer depression. Sunny is a mental disposition, and not just one reserved for beaches and fun parks. Level 1 injected a positive mood into the ski season – giving a dose of light therapy to dark northern landscapes of Scandinavia, Alaska, Japan and British Columbia.

What is a sensational effort for an able-bodied rider may well have been the ultimate challenge for Walter Van Praag with 35% lung function (due to Cystic Fibrosis), Daniel Kojta who is paraplegic and uses a hand-cycle, and Conrad Wansbrough who suffers from a debilitating spinal injury. What is a steady and manageable hill climb to the summit of Kosciuszko for some, was a monumental achievement for Paul Pritchard with half a working body (due to Hemiplegia). To get there, Paul rode a custom built tandem-recumbent-trike with Duncan Meerding, who has 5% remaining vision, although that didn’t stop him from pushing the trike along some of the steepest and roughest parts of the road. Accompanied by a romping great soundtrack, the riders travel through stunning and varied Australian landscapes, cruising past road critters and through clouds of dust kicked up by the onslaught of passing road trains, recuperating in riverside campsites and seeking bike repair shops along the way. The documentary captures the banter, the hardship &amp; remarkable determination they have to complete the journey.

Every time you set sail you dream of finding a new land, but sometimes you just go in circles. During this voyage we came down with mad cow disease &amp; won ski film of the year.

Which would leave me to wonder if we should have gotten mad cow disease sooner. Producing Ski movies is a carbon-intensive process, and The Bunch understands that.

Life can be beautiful. Life can be messy. Add in the struggles of addiction and life can often become overwhelming. Harvey uses rock climbing to help him overcome his addictions and mental health struggles, all while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. As trauma, depression, heartbreak and declining mental health were woven into Harvey&apos;s internal fabric, so was rock climbing. Climbing gave him purpose and helped him to connect with nature, with others and with himself. Passion and healing followed but his mental health was to be massively tested by the global pandemic, with self-isolation forcing Harvey away from the climbing lifestyle. Crux tells the story of Harvey’s recovery as he learns to love himself amidst the mountains of his life. The beautiful peaks of British Columbia, Canada contrast the dark lonely space inside Harvey’s Vancouver apartment.

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc></programme>

A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat. On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500.&quot; From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries. Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016. The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks.

Los Angeles spent years striving to emulate towns like New York or San Francisco, but over the last decade the city took a long hard look in the mirror, dug what it saw, and started focusing on what it does best: casual, multicultural, and effortlessly cool.The new LA is the place everyone suddenly wants to be, where high and low converge on palm-lined sidewalks. The countrys most thriving food scene is here, run by a guerilla band of ethnically diverse chefs cooking up whatever they want, wherever they want, with the best produce in the world. From the industrial warehouses east of downtown to the beachside shopping meccas of Venice, LAs cutting edge street style, art scene, and culinary chops cant be contained—the creative energy pops through the concrete like ficus roots. And just to sweeten the deal, 280-plus days of breezy sunshine form the backdrop of it all. Just dont forget your shades.</desc></programme>

Its also home to a huge range of chic bars and restaurants to suit all tastes and moods. And, of course, it has those iconic towers that define its famous skyline. One of the best ways to admire the architecture around Dubai Marina is from the deck of a boat. You can charter a private yacht, hop onboard an organised boat tour - or you can even cross the marina for as little as €2 in a water taxi. Five-star resorts hug the coastline. Their vast, marble-clad lobbies lead to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunch venues and postcard-perfect beaches. As for Dubai Marinas beach clubs, from Drift to Zero Gravity , they are dizzyingly beautiful; their pool decks are catwalks for the latest swimwear fashions. Jumereirah Beach Residence Jumeirah Beach Residence itself is the largest single-phase commercial and residential project in the world. Its strategically lined along a chic waterfront strip known as The Walk , feautring stunning 3D murals. The Walk has a very varied range of fashion, home and handicraft shops and boutiques. The outdoor pop-up market stalls offer jewellery, food treats and homeware, as well as performances by street entertainers. Jumereirah Beach Residence is made up of 40 high-rise buildings divided into six clusters, all with superb access to first-class retailers, entertainment venues and restaurants. Up on the Flying Cup The adjacent cosmopolitan shopping area The Beach has many attractions, including the floating adventure park Aqua Fun . This amazing water park makes a statement, by spelling out &quot;I ♡ Dubai&quot; via is pools and slides when seen from above. Another highlight at The Beach is The Flying Cup , a ride that you can sit in and be elevated to fabulous views, seen in all their glory from 40 metres up - while eating and drinking!

Camel races Old meets new can be seen at Dubais Camel Racing Club where these ships of the desert sprint across the perimeter of the famed Al Mamoom racetrack. Attracting both camel owners and punters alike, spectators can sit in their cars and drive alongside the camels as they hurtle towards the finish line, guided by a remote control jockey. Organisers say the event is a draw for tourists for a number of reasons. “When tourists come to the camel racing venues, they see something new. They see how people treat the camels and how the camels compete with each other. They also see how Emirati society promotes camels, says the clubs CEO and General Amanager Ali Saeed Bin Saroud. Camel racing was promoted by the former UAE president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as a way of bringing camels and back into mainstream Dubai culture. The Dubai Royal Family also actively support camel racing as a way of preserving the traditional Bedouin culture. Desert culture The Al Marmoom Heritage Festival is Dubai’s annual celebration of the traditional Arabian desert culture and vital role which it plays in the cultural identity of its people. Traditional markets, music and dancing are another way in which the Bedouin culture is kept alive and enjoyed by Dubai locals and tourists alike. Arabic hospitality German expat Ursula Musch moved to Dubai around 20 years ago after first visiting in 1993. She now breeds camels and encourages tourists to experience the Bedouin customs for themselves, as they, like her, may just find their passion in life. My passion or my message is I want to give foreigners, other people the chance to know something from the Arabic hospitality, from their tradition, from their culture, to show it to give it to other people who don’t</desc></programme>

In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.

Home to Alserkal Avenue – actually a block of streets lined with some of the best art galleries in Dubai – Al Quoz is full of surprises. There’s more than world-class art hidden behind Al Quozs vast landscape of warehouses; where theres art, theres life, after all – and life here is vibrant. Just about every enterprise in Al Quoz comes with an exciting twist; for example, Al Quoz restaurant and speciality coffee bar Café Rider  doubles as a custom motorbike store. Mirzam , meanwhile, is an artisan chocolate factory thats also a café, located in the neighbourhood’s central art hub,  Alserkal Avenue . Alserkal Avenue cafes are defined by their fair-trade principles and creative concoctions that echo the area’s artistic character. From golden turmeric lattes to immune-boosting vegan matcha bowls, menus are bursting with goodness. Things to do in Alserkal Avenue and neighbouring complex, The Courtyard, include inspiring workshops; there are several to choose between. At  Oo La Lab , a fragrance mixology studio in Alserkal Avenue, you can learn how to create your own signature cologne. Or, just across the road, you can join an art class in Dubai’s popular community art space  thejamjar . Going strong for 15 years, thejamjar is a regular host of Alserkal Avenue events and art lessons, teaches budding artists of all ages several disciplines, from painting with oils to acrylic techniques. Tilika D’Souza, an art instructor at thejamjar, says the wellbeing of the participants is also important to the foundation: &quot;We have a workshop called  Intuitive Creativity  that combines meditation and art; we use all kinds of different art materials and we do a little meditation to begin with, so everybody is really relaxed during and after the class.&quot; For those who prefer to shop, tempting retail options include independent boutiques, such as Chi-Ka , a</desc></programme>

But Ocean Active Fly has re-imagined this scene - offering urban fly fishing right in the middle of Dubai. This is the first fly fishing operation in the Middle East. The founder, Nick Bowles, explained to Euronews why fishing there are fishing opportunities in Dubai: &quot;Dubai’s built the biggest man-made reefs with the palm islands and that, so it’s created a huge habitat.&quot; Artificial reefs can lead to a quick increase in the local fish population. They draw plankton which smaller fish can prey on which then attracts bigger fish suitable for fly fishing. One species drawn to the artificial reefs in Dubai is the queenfish. They can grow to be over a metre long and up to 15 kilograms, although most are about half that weight. This kind of fish is particularly good for fly fishing because of its visual takes and the fact it swims in schools. Fly fishing differs from more conventional spin fishing. Instead of having a heavy lure at the end of the fishing line, fly fishers have a fly which is lighter and less likely to scare away game. The fly stays on the surface of the water where fish will be attracted to it, thinking it is prey. With ocean fly fishing youre constantly on the move to find the next school of fish &quot;So you literally run - shoot, run - shoot.&quot; But the unique part of fly fishing in Dubai is the proximity to its skyline. Fly fishing is done close to the shore so anglers are surrounded by the citys landmarks.: the Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina.</desc></programme>

Michela Colella, Operations Manager, Divers Down UAE said, &quot;We will go to an average depth of 14 metres. We’ll look for trumpet fish, triggerfish, clownfish, pufferfish, boxfish.&quot; Even with the basic training completed, diving with an instructor helps you feel safer, develop the right habits, and take in all the best spots on the dive site. Some of the most spectacular coral and marine life are located just 5 metres from the surface. At that depth, everything is lit up beautifully and the air lasts much longer than at 10 or 15 metres. The reef has species ranging from stingrays to lobsters, jawfish, parrotfish, broomtail wrasse, and many others. For more experienced divers there are dozens of shipwrecks and artificial reefs to explore each with unique histories and coral formations. At times it feels as if you’re flying in slow motion in some sort of alien landscape. And before you know it, it’s time to come back to the real world. Euronews James OHagan exclaimed, &quot;Oh!

Vanessa’s restaurant celebrates delicious dishes and memorable moments. She talks us through her inspiration behind what is one of Taipei’s most warm and authentic French dining experiences.Interview: Vanessa HuangActually our restaurant is unlike others in Taiwan, in that our menu is different everyday. We make adjustments based on our daily findings at the market, and we design our menu around that. For example, if we see really fresh seafood or vegetables or meat, we’ll put that on the menu.I can’t really say that I have one signature dish, and even when our guests keep coming week after week asking for a specific dish, I get bored of making the same thing and will want to move on to something else. What I like is giving our guests something new every time.A very special moment for me is when my parents go to the fields themselves and handpick ingredients for me, like lemongrass, lily flower root, etc, and I’ll use them to make ice cream or appetizers. And the part that makes me most proud and happy is when I get to tell our customers, ‘this was handpicked by my mom!’. But of course, it doesn’t happen often, only sometimes when the chance arises.I went to France at the end of 2002, to attend the cooking school, Ferrandi. At the time I just wanted to have my own little coffee shop, like most young girls. But one day my chef, my mentor at the school, asked me if I wanted to do a stage (internship) at a 3 starred Michelin restaurant, he thought it was a great opportunity for me. I agreed, not even knowing what Michelin was, and that experience would go on to change my life.Being the only female and foreigner student during my stage, I didn’t want to lose to everyone else, and I would push myself to keep up. Although it was daunting and disheartening when I couldn’t understand my teacher, I continued to give it my all, and at the time I felt like maybe I was working harder than othe</desc></programme>

Around the world, aging populations, rising healthcare costs, and pressures on the insurance industry have created opportunities for destinations like Dubai , that have been able to invest rapidly in their healthcare infrastructure and capitalise on the sharp increase in demand for health tourism. Encouraging international institutions Dr Marwan Mohamed Al Mulla, CEO, Health Regulation Sector, Dubai Health Authority said, “Recently a new law has come into effect which encourages and allows international institutions to have their own, 100 percent ownership The Dubai Health Authority has had a medical tourism strategy in place since 2014 with the aim of developing and supporting its healthcare sector and steadily increasing its contribution towards Dubais gross domestic product. Focusing on an inbound patient’s airport-to-airport needs has helped providers capitalise too. Dr Basel Nasrallah, Medical Director, Armada said, “We in our facility, for example, get about 5 percent more patients from abroad. Patients are coming from all around the world. We are receiving patients from Russia, mainly Europe, Italy, Spain, UK, and North America from Africa, from South Asia Why have health checks in Dubai? Interestingly, many of those countries are known for the strength of their own medical tourism offerings, but Dubai is still an attractive option for patients who are looking to combine their treatments with other pursuits.

Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc></programme>

This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: &quot;The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below 80 percent in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals.&quot; Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: &quot;It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve.&quot; iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc></programme>

La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club, Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free. La Mer’s shops focus on beach pursuits and accessories, making it a good place to shop for swimwear, sunglasses, suntan lotion</desc></programme>

This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers. Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches. Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts. Local expats regularly fill the resort’s Barasti bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include Drift to Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions. Open until late, Zero Gravity is known for its high-octane parties and voyeuristic glass-sided pool. Sun worshippers on Dubai Marina’s deep sandy beaches pose for photos that frame its remarkable urban skyline.

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc></programme>

She describes one of the restaurants that features on the tours itinerary. &quot;One of the restaurants we stop on our tour is called Sultan Dubai Falafel,&quot; she says. &quot;And the thing that they are known for is stuffed falafels. They stuff them with chilli, onion and sumac. These falafels are the most juiciest most filled with herbs and fragrant falafels that you’re going to find in the city.&quot; Deira’s Waterfront market is piled high with technicolour fruit and vegetables and stacks of shellfish with legs choreographed in chorus-line unison. Here you can buy the catch of the day and have it cooked in many different ways for old-school Creekside dining. Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary Until recently, the creek ended at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Here nature lovers can spot flamingos that migrate to the Sanctuary, a wetland extension of the creek spread over 6.2 sq.km. It features a variety of mangroves and lagoons perfect for migrating birds - the sanctuary is home to over 180 species of birds. Following its expansion as Dubai Canal, the creek curves past book-shaped Mohammed Bin Rashid Library, high-rise Business Bay and beach-hugging Jumeirah before it’s reunited with its source - the glittering Arabian Gulf.</desc></programme>

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash. If you think you have a samurai spirit, this should feel like home.</desc></programme>

About the size of 60 rugby fields, it has been created to give visitors some green space and a better understanding of Islamic beliefs. Inside the park’s orchards and Glass House, visitors can discover a variety of healthy and medicinal flora featured in the Holy Quran, from pomegranates and olives, to figs and garlic. Another attraction at Quranic Park is the Cave of Miracles, where seven miracles recounted in the Holy Quran play out on the walls. &quot;The cave was amazing,&quot; says Usman, who is visiting from the UK. &quot;We learnt a lot about the miracles growing up, it just gave another understanding to it. And it was great to visualise it, not just hear about it.&quot; &quot;This is an open example that the Quran is not just to read in order to get reward but it is something that can be in practical life,&quot; says Anwar, a visitor from the US. &quot;This place is beautiful and a very interesting experience for children. Here, they can actually experience things from the Quran,&quot; says Miteab, who lives in Saudi Arabia.  Al Shindagha Perfume House From aromatic flora to the UAE’s first museum dedicated to fragrance. The Al Shindagha museum is home to the  Perfume House . Part of a complex created to gather, preserve and share Emirati heritage, Perfume House charts the history and role of fragrance in the region.

This huge tree-shaped island was built from sand, rock and sheer determination. What keeps it all in place is this 11-kilometer breakwater crescent, lined with five-star hotels, this protective halo has two openings side that allows the famously clear blue waters to flow with the tide. Seventy-eight thousand residents call Palm Jumeirah home, living in luxury apartment blocks on the trunk and private gated estates on the fronds. Its also the address of some of Dubais most exclusive hotel accommodation from Anantaras overwater villas to Atlantiss underwater suites. Elsewhere at Skyline Defining Atlantis, there’s a world-class water park and a network of aquariums filled with 65000 inhabitants. And for a truly surreal experience, you can even walk among them. Or perhaps you prefer to fly? The latest way to get a birds eye view of this manmade megastructure in a gyrocopter. Similar to helicopters, two-seat aircraft reach heights of fifteen hundred feet. Another way to explore Palm Jumeirah is by sea, and the 78-kilometer shoreline is dotted with idyllic seaside destinations. &quot;Club Vista Mare is tucked away on the eastern trunk, very popular destination for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one ‘star’ attraction of Vista Mare is its pool in the sea,&quot; says Rebecca Rees. And the new Palm Tower will showcase a wraparound infinity pool on the 50th floor, providing unparalleled views of this iconic island.</desc></programme>

Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too. Do take advantage of that.</desc></programme>

From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer.

But, in fact, its history goes back more than 5,000 years. Archaeologists have unearthed a series of exciting and mysterious discoveries across the Emirate. These include the Jumeirah Archaeological site, which dates back to the Abbasid Period in the 10th century AD, to the Saruq Al Hadid site – a centre for human inhabitants and trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600-2000 BCE) to the Iron Age. When the Jumeirah Archaeological site was discovered, experts noticed that the walls of the buildings there were plastered. Dr Mansour Boraik, an archaeology specialist from Dubai, said: &quot;It was plastered inside and outside with white plaster. When they tried to picture the city during the Abbasid Period, and they imagined that it would look like a white city from the shores of the Gulf.&quot; The site shows Dubai during the Abbasid period which is around the 10th century AD. The geographical location of the site is important. It sits on the shoreline of Dubai but also on the major trade route between Mesopotamia, India and Oman. It also sits in-between the Arabic and Indian peninsular. The 80,000 square metre site sits in the shadow of the Burj Khalifa and the imposing Dubai skyline, emphasising the comparison between old and new worlds. The circular and semi-circular tower supports reflect the prosperity of the inhabitants of the time who will have been a mixture of locals and passing tradesmen. A variety of silver coins, pottery, copper, glass and stone artefacts have been excavated. Its one of the largest and most important Islamic sites ever discovered in the Gulf. It is also home to the oldest Mosque discovered in the UAE. Saruq al Hadid Saruq al Hadid is regarded as the jewel in the crown of archaeological discoveries In Dubai. This ancient industrial metallurgical centre dates back to the Iron Age and indicates that Dubai was a global trading hub.

Nothing can prepare visitors for the true scale of record-breaking Burj Khalifa . At twice the height of the Empire State Building and almost three times the size of the Eiffel Tower, it soars 828 metres into the sky. Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148. Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door, The Dubai Mall houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and Dubai Mall’s indoor ice rink is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest VR Park in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes. Bustling with entertainment, Downtown Dubai’s high-octane epicentre is looped by the laidback, café-lined Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Boulevard – a starting point for a public art trail. Downtown Dubai is an urban canvas of sculptures</desc></programme>

No more. We can easily go up to 12,000 feet. In case we have an engine failure, it’s just doing this (Jos turns off engine).&quot; Paramotors are one of the smallest aircraft in the world and have a great safety record because the engine is only needed for gaining altitude and can be switched off when you come back down to land. &quot;We will do a spiral.

The meal that follows is known as Iftar, and you do not have to be Muslim to partake in one. In this edition of Taste, Euronews visited the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel in Dubai, to sample the special Iftar menu produced by the worlds first Emirati chef. After Athan, the call for evening prayer, Muslims who have been fasting all day can finally eat and drink. The fast is broken by first eating dates. This is of great religious significance, chef Musabbeh Al Kaabi explained. &quot;Prophet Mohammed used to do this when he was breaking his fast, so we always break it with the dates then laban (a fermented milk drink) or water,&quot; he said. Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. &quot;Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas. Now I need to take the flavour of the onions with all these things,&quot; Chef Musabbeh said as he prepared the dish. &quot;I will put the rice in now. I’ll put some spices in as well. So now, I’m going to put it on a plate, and I’m going to garnish it&quot; But, before eating, everyone said Bismillā, which means in the name of Allah. Chef Musabbeh then prepared his second dish the famous Emirati ouzi with oriental rice, a lamb dish with cinnamon and cardamom. You can make the dish yourself by following the recipe below: Chef Musabbehs Ouzi and Oriental Rice Recipe Ingredients: 1100g lamb shank 500g of basmati rice 100g of minced lamb 2 bay leaves 3 cinnamon sticks 10g of garlic - freshly chopped 120g of onion - freshly chopped 100g of tomato - freshly chopped 20g of ghee butter Salt and pepper 6.5ml of water 10g of tamarind powder 40g of Emirati spices 30g of tomato paste 40g of coriander - freshly chopped Instructions: 1.

It has the most amazing sunrises which I delighted in each day from my private balcony. The hotel is located directly on the beach which makes it very difficult to leave. I visit the charming beachside town of Lauderdale by the Sea, a 10 minute drive from my hotel. I also take a tour at Butterfly World, the first and largest butterfly house in the United States. It is home over 80 species of butterflies, hummingbird and lorikeet aviaries, and outdoor gardens. This place is truly magical for people of all ages. Pompano Beach is the quintessential beach town.

Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served .

With over a billion people watching, Beijing seems to manage the task with dignified ease. The pace of life in this city speaks volumes about its personality and its characters. The mood is steady, confident, and proud.  With walls that never end, ducks that bear golden skin, and Forbidden Cities out in the open, Beijing has a storybook magic that can only be found in a megacity overflowing with such rich history and tradition. The landmarks and landscapes are dominant forces, followed by the new developments mounted by modernization. Knowing where to look will be the key to unlocking the cities best adventures and experiences. Don’t be afraid to explore the many interesting nooks and crannies of Beijing’s streets and alleys, as there are many. From the bucket list worthy monuments, to the waves of new restaurants, shops, and cultural encounters available, be sure not to rush. Beijing is a hotbed of commerce and entrepreneurship, and inspires the country’s top artists, students, writers, film-makers, musicians, and creatives to converge within its frontiers. With so much to explore in one of the oldest cities on the planet, traveling somewhere else seems irresponsible - there’s no place like ‘the capital.’</desc></programme>

She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience.

In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep - took off in one from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring. “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.” Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.” Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc></programme>

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash. If you think you have a samurai spirit, this should feel like home.</desc></programme>

There arent many meals that can claim royal lineage dating back almost a thousand years to the ancient emperors of China. Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc></programme>

La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club, Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free. La Mer’s shops focus on beach pursuits and accessories, making it a good place to shop for swimwear, sunglasses, suntan lotion</desc></programme>

With a fanbase of 20 million and growing, Duncan has been approached by various renowned companies, such as Line, Asus, and TVBS for creative collaborations. He uses a caricature of himself as the main protagonist in his comics, which are centered around the hilarious going-ons of his daily life. With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc></programme>

Looking at her million-watt smile now, little would one have guessed that Liya also went through a dark period in her life. When she won the ELLE Model Look competition back in 2005, at the very height of her career, she bid farewell to the life of glitz and glamour and moved to Shanghai to live a quiet life of marital bliss with her then-newly-wed husband, Lin Yongchao. Just two years into the marriage, the once happy couple divorced and went their separate ways. The period that followed was a downward spiral that Liya finds hard to look back upon even now. Yet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she found a new burning passion that reawakened her zest for life - her love of fitness and exercise.Today, Liya has taken time out of her day to tell us her story and recent endeavors. With smooth, sun-kissed skin and minimal make up, Liya flashes us her pearly-whites that remind us of the famous Disney character, Pocahontas. Growing up, becoming a model never crossed Liya’s mind. She perceived her tanned skin and naturally curly hair as against the norm of what was considered aesthetically beautiful, and was naturally surprised when she was approached by a stylist while strolling in Ximending, one of Taipei’s popular shopping districts. The stylist asked her to go in for a casting at Eelin, the model management company in which she is currently still signed to today. As it was Summer break and she had little to do, Liya decided to go to the casting with little expectations, and thus unwittingly began her fifteen-year-long career.It wasn’t all smooth sailing from there, especially the first couple of years into the modelling business. Liya found herself trying to be someone else, fitting into the mold of the successful models before her, afraid to stand out and be herself. Her skin tone, her h</desc></programme>

This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: &quot;The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below 80 percent in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals.&quot; Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: &quot;It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve.&quot; iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc></programme>

Around the world, aging populations, rising healthcare costs, and pressures on the insurance industry have created opportunities for destinations like Dubai , that have been able to invest rapidly in their healthcare infrastructure and capitalise on the sharp increase in demand for health tourism. Encouraging international institutions Dr Marwan Mohamed Al Mulla, CEO, Health Regulation Sector, Dubai Health Authority said, “Recently a new law has come into effect which encourages and allows international institutions to have their own, 100 percent ownership The Dubai Health Authority has had a medical tourism strategy in place since 2014 with the aim of developing and supporting its healthcare sector and steadily increasing its contribution towards Dubais gross domestic product. Focusing on an inbound patient’s airport-to-airport needs has helped providers capitalise too. Dr Basel Nasrallah, Medical Director, Armada said, “We in our facility, for example, get about 5 percent more patients from abroad. Patients are coming from all around the world. We are receiving patients from Russia, mainly Europe, Italy, Spain, UK, and North America from Africa, from South Asia Why have health checks in Dubai? Interestingly, many of those countries are known for the strength of their own medical tourism offerings, but Dubai is still an attractive option for patients who are looking to combine their treatments with other pursuits.

When it comes to Taiwan and food, experts and enthusiasts alike know that they go hand-in-hand.  It is no wonder Taipei is overflowing with electricity as new ideas and re-imagined classics are popping up all over town. This magical friction is a big reason Taipei’s food scene is attracting young talent from the world’s best kitchens looking to experiment, innovate, and test their ideas against the discerning palates of the local crowds.  Highlighted by some of the world’s best produce, great transportation, magnificent hiking trails 5 minutes from downtown, a vibrant nightlife, and an openness towards travelers and new faces makes Taipei one of Black Buddha’s favorite cities.</desc></programme>

Namie’s futuristic robot-inspired venue is as visually stimulating as it is entertaining and interactive. She walks us through her inspiration for what now has become a staple experience for locals and global travellers.Interview: NAMIE OSAWA I opened Robot Restaurant three years ago. Even though I was hesitant to show the first concept to foreigners and so forth, I decided to open the restaurant in Kabukicho with the Japanese Businessman in mind. When thinking about what would be appealing to a businessman, I thought about Robots - which I longed for as a kid,..and Girls in sexy costumes. These were the things that initially came to mind. Our rehearsals begin at 11 o’clock in the morning including Wadaiko, which is a Japanese drum dance. We practice for about an hour and thirty minutes, then we have a brief meeting before the show. Rehearsals can be tough, but whatever we go over, ..it’s amazing and we have fun and I think it’s very good. Still, I think that there is a part where not a lot of the content catches on with the audience. Even after repeated viewings, I would like to think that each show was better than the one before it. But on the name alone, people were intrigued and when it arrived, it was beyond the imagination because I wanted it to be a thoughtful experience. Always keep going forward, it’s what we want out of this show. I want to make sure there’s more to it than just a name.</desc></programme>

From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational,&quot; she explains. &quot;It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So, you’re looking for something that is bright, that real</desc></programme>

His passion for authenticity and obsession for comfort, pours out every minute you spend here. This place has a charming personality and we went directly to the source.Interview: MARCO BETTIOWhen I came here 10 years ago and started to do some consulting. I started to receive a lot of guests from all around the world..and I was always forced to bring them to fine dining places. I noticed that my clients weren’t really comfortable in the fine dining experience the first day they arrived in Shanghai.That’s what moved me to bring this real Italian dining experience to this area. I would say that we would always try to give a tailormade type of service. Greeting everybody, making them feel comfortable, it’s one of the most important things for us.Actually, “Goodfellas”..is meant to mean “good friends”..and this is the idea. There is no ego, there is no name of the chef, or my name on the door,..nothing but “Goodfellas.” It’s a place to for a good time with your friends, business partners, clients..to have an intimate experience in an enjoyable way.Chef Antonio is a great master, we actually call him “the maestro”,..it’s the italian way to address a very experienced chef. Since day one, Chef has been in charge of everything inside the kitchen...scouting the best ingredients and creating the recipes. Coming from big hotels, he initially wanted the kitchen to be very serious, less smiling, less interactive, etc..I never agreed with this, so we had to find a balance. And it took almost a year until we found that balance,...after he saw the happy customers and atmosphere we knew we were on to something and it because very harmonic. There is never an argument between the kitchen and the staff, and it’s amazing. This is a very big achievement..norma</desc></programme>

For just one dirham, abra rides provide boatloads of nostalgia while travelling between the souks and museums of Deira and Bur Dubai. These heritage hubs recall the Bedouins’ humble and ancient past built on pearls, and then shaped by a free trade boom that brought new settlers to the creek in the early 1900’s. Echoing that era, today’s expats – some descendants of those early traders – share authentic flavours from their homelands in a culinary kaleidoscope that compliments Emirati fare. Popular food tours Food tours are a popular way to explore Dubai Creek. Arva Ahmed is the founder of Frying Pan Adventures. She describes one of the restaurants that features on the tours itinerary. &quot;One of the restaurants we stop on our tour is called Sultan Dubai Falafel,&quot; she says. &quot;And the thing that they are known for is stuffed falafels. They stuff them with chilli, onion and sumac. These falafels are the most juiciest most filled with herbs and fragrant falafels that you’re going to find in the city.&quot; Deira’s Waterfront market is piled high with technicolour fruit and vegetables and stacks of shellfish with legs choreographed in chorus-line unison. Here you can buy the catch of the day and have it cooked in many different ways for old-school Creekside dining. Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary Until recently, the creek ended at Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary. Here nature lovers can spot flamingos that migrate to the Sanctuary, a wetland extension of the creek spread over 6.2 sq.km. It features a variety of mangroves and lagoons perfect for migrating birds - the sanctuary is home to over 180 species of birds. Following its expansion as Dubai Canal, the creek curves past book-shaped Mohammed Bin Rashid Library, high-rise Business Bay and beach-hugging Jumeirah before it’s reunited with its source - the glittering Arabian Gulf.</desc></programme>

In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.

A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat. On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500.&quot; From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries. Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016. The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks.

It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc></programme>

My journey begins at the Orlando World Center Marriott, home to the biggest most amazing pool I’ve ever seen. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that mermaid classes are offered through the Mermaid Academy, poolside. The real adventure begins at the Paddling Center at Shingle Creek, which is a quick drive from the hotel. Lined with Cypress trees and the beautiful sounds of nature, it was the perfect setting for a relaxing kayak experience. I end my time in Orlando shopping at Artegon Marketplace. This is mall filled with local artisans who are passionate about their work and products.

Michela Colella, Operations Manager, Divers Down UAE said, &quot;We will go to an average depth of 14 metres. We’ll look for trumpet fish, triggerfish, clownfish, pufferfish, boxfish.&quot; Even with the basic training completed, diving with an instructor helps you feel safer, develop the right habits, and take in all the best spots on the dive site. Some of the most spectacular coral and marine life are located just 5 metres from the surface. At that depth, everything is lit up beautifully and the air lasts much longer than at 10 or 15 metres. The reef has species ranging from stingrays to lobsters, jawfish, parrotfish, broomtail wrasse, and many others. For more experienced divers there are dozens of shipwrecks and artificial reefs to explore each with unique histories and coral formations.

But, in fact, its history goes back more than 5,000 years. Archaeologists have unearthed a series of exciting and mysterious discoveries across the Emirate. These include the Jumeirah Archaeological site, which dates back to the Abbasid Period in the 10th century AD, to the Saruq Al Hadid site – a centre for human inhabitants and trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600-2000 BCE) to the Iron Age. When the Jumeirah Archaeological site was discovered, experts noticed that the walls of the buildings there were plastered. Dr Mansour Boraik, an archaeology specialist from Dubai, said: &quot;It was plastered inside and outside with white plaster. When they tried to picture the city during the Abbasid Period, and they imagined that it would look like a white city from the shores of the Gulf.&quot; The site shows Dubai during the Abbasid period which is around the 10th century AD. The geographical location of the site is important. It sits on the shoreline of Dubai but also on the major trade route between Mesopotamia, India and Oman. It also sits in-between the Arabic and Indian peninsular. The 80,000 square metre site sits in the shadow of the Burj Khalifa and the imposing Dubai skyline, emphasising the comparison between old and new worlds. The circular and semi-circular tower supports reflect the prosperity of the inhabitants of the time who will have been a mixture of locals and passing tradesmen. A variety of silver coins, pottery, copper, glass and stone artefacts have been excavated. Its one of the largest and most important Islamic sites ever discovered in the Gulf. It is also home to the oldest Mosque discovered in the UAE. Saruq al Hadid Saruq al Hadid is regarded as the jewel in the crown of archaeological discoveries In Dubai.

Los Angeles spent years striving to emulate towns like New York or San Francisco, but over the last decade the city took a long hard look in the mirror, dug what it saw, and started focusing on what it does best: casual, multicultural, and effortlessly cool.The new LA is the place everyone suddenly wants to be, where high and low converge on palm-lined sidewalks. The countrys most thriving food scene is here, run by a guerilla band of ethnically diverse chefs cooking up whatever they want, wherever they want, with the best produce in the world. From the industrial warehouses east of downtown to the beachside shopping meccas of Venice, LAs cutting edge street style, art scene, and culinary chops cant be contained—the creative energy pops through the concrete like ficus roots.

Vanessa’s restaurant celebrates delicious dishes and memorable moments. She talks us through her inspiration behind what is one of Taipei’s most warm and authentic French dining experiences.Interview: Vanessa HuangActually our restaurant is unlike others in Taiwan, in that our menu is different everyday. We make adjustments based on our daily findings at the market, and we design our menu around that. For example, if we see really fresh seafood or vegetables or meat, we’ll put that on the menu.I can’t really say that I have one signature dish, and even when our guests keep coming week after week asking for a specific dish, I get bored of making the same thing and will want to move on to something else. What I like is giving our guests something new every time.A very special moment for me is when my parents go to the fields themselves and handpick ingredients for me, like lemongrass, lily flower root, etc, and I’ll use them to make ice cream or appetizers. And the part that makes me most proud and happy is when I get to tell our customers, ‘this was handpicked by my mom!’. But of course, it doesn’t happen often, only sometimes when the chance arises.I went to France at the end of 2002, to attend the cooking school, Ferrandi. At the time I just wanted to have my own little coffee shop, like most young girls. But one day my chef, my mentor at the school, asked me if I wanted to do a stage (internship) at a 3 starred Michelin restaurant, he thought it was a great opportunity for me. I agreed, not even knowing what Michelin was, and that experience would go on to change my life.Being the only female and foreigner student during my stage, I didn’t want to lose to everyone else, and I would push myself to keep up. Although it was daunting and disheartening when I couldn’t understand my teacher, I continued to give it my all, and at the time I felt like maybe I was working harder than othe</desc></programme>

It’s a place that perfectly embodies old and new Tokyo, a university town that attracts more than students. It’s a great place to live (some even think it’s one of the best kept secrets of Tokyo) with just about everything you need in one place — restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and easy access to just about any other part of the city. While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other. With friendly and fiercely proud locals who want to share the area’s history, from origami to the Kanda Myojin Shrine, this is a quieter part of Tokyo just waiting to be discovered.</desc></programme>

This huge tree-shaped island was built from sand, rock and sheer determination. What keeps it all in place is this 11-kilometer breakwater crescent, lined with five-star hotels, this protective halo has two openings side that allows the famously clear blue waters to flow with the tide. Seventy-eight thousand residents call Palm Jumeirah home, living in luxury apartment blocks on the trunk and private gated estates on the fronds. Its also the address of some of Dubais most exclusive hotel accommodation from Anantaras overwater villas to Atlantiss underwater suites. Elsewhere at Skyline Defining Atlantis, there’s a world-class water park and a network of aquariums filled with 65000 inhabitants. And for a truly surreal experience, you can even walk among them. Or perhaps you prefer to fly? The latest way to get a birds eye view of this manmade megastructure in a gyrocopter. Similar to helicopters, two-seat aircraft reach heights of fifteen hundred feet. Another way to explore Palm Jumeirah is by sea, and the 78-kilometer shoreline is dotted with idyllic seaside destinations. &quot;Club Vista Mare is tucked away on the eastern trunk, very popular destination for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one ‘star’ attraction of Vista Mare is its pool in the sea,&quot; says Rebecca Rees. And the new Palm Tower will showcase a wraparound infinity pool on the 50th floor, providing unparalleled views of this iconic island.</desc></programme>

This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers. Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches. Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts. Local expats regularly fill the resort’s Barasti bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include Drift to Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions. Open until late, Zero Gravity is known for its high-octane parties and voyeuristic glass-sided pool. Sun worshippers on Dubai Marina’s deep sandy beaches pose for photos that frame its remarkable urban skyline. It’s a backdrop that’s hard to miss, containing some of the tallest residential towers in the world. The 101-storey Princess Tower once claimed the title of the highest, while the Cayan Tower retains its record for the world’s tallest building with a 90-degree twist; it’s structure akin to a giant corkscrew.

But Ocean Active Fly has re-imagined this scene - offering urban fly fishing right in the middle of Dubai. This is the first fly fishing operation in the Middle East. The founder, Nick Bowles, explained to Euronews why fishing there are fishing opportunities in Dubai: &quot;Dubai’s built the biggest man-made reefs with the palm islands and that, so it’s created a huge habitat.&quot; Artificial reefs can lead to a quick increase in the local fish population. They draw plankton which smaller fish can prey on which then attracts bigger fish suitable for fly fishing. One species drawn to the artificial reefs in Dubai is the queenfish. They can grow to be over a metre long and up to 15 kilograms, although most are about half that weight. This kind of fish is particularly good for fly fishing because of its visual takes and the fact it swims in schools. Fly fishing differs from more conventional spin fishing. Instead of having a heavy lure at the end of the fishing line, fly fishers have a fly which is lighter and less likely to scare away game. The fly stays on the surface of the water where fish will be attracted to it, thinking it is prey. With ocean fly fishing youre constantly on the move to find the next school of fish &quot;So you literally run - shoot, run - shoot.&quot; But the unique part of fly fishing in Dubai is the proximity to its skyline. Fly fishing is done close to the shore so anglers are surrounded by the citys landmarks.: the Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina.</desc></programme>

Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop. Although it will be a longer wait, do yourself a favor and go for dinner for the best experience.</desc></programme>

Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc></programme>

Camel races Old meets new can be seen at Dubais Camel Racing Club where these ships of the desert sprint across the perimeter of the famed Al Mamoom racetrack. Attracting both camel owners and punters alike, spectators can sit in their cars and drive alongside the camels as they hurtle towards the finish line, guided by a remote control jockey. Organisers say the event is a draw for tourists for a number of reasons. “When tourists come to the camel racing venues, they see something new. They see how people treat the camels and how the camels compete with each other. They also see how Emirati society promotes camels, says the clubs CEO and General Amanager Ali Saeed Bin Saroud. Camel racing was promoted by the former UAE president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as a way of bringing camels and back into mainstream Dubai culture. The Dubai Royal Family also actively support camel racing as a way of preserving the traditional Bedouin culture. Desert culture The Al Marmoom Heritage Festival is Dubai’s annual celebration of the traditional Arabian desert culture and vital role which it plays in the cultural identity of its people. Traditional markets, music and dancing are another way in which the Bedouin culture is kept alive and enjoyed by Dubai locals and tourists alike. Arabic hospitality German expat Ursula Musch moved to Dubai around 20 years ago after first visiting in 1993. She now breeds camels and encourages tourists to experience the Bedouin customs for themselves, as they, like her, may just find their passion in life. My passion or my message is I want to give foreigners, other people the chance to know something from the Arabic hospitality, from their tradition, from their culture, to show it to give it to other people who don’t</desc></programme>

Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too.

The meal that follows is known as Iftar, and you do not have to be Muslim to partake in one. In this edition of Taste, Euronews visited the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel in Dubai, to sample the special Iftar menu produced by the worlds first Emirati chef. After Athan, the call for evening prayer, Muslims who have been fasting all day can finally eat and drink. The fast is broken by first eating dates. This is of great religious significance, chef Musabbeh Al Kaabi explained. &quot;Prophet Mohammed used to do this when he was breaking his fast, so we always break it with the dates then laban (a fermented milk drink) or water,&quot; he said. Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. &quot;Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas. Now I need to take the flavour of the onions with all these things,&quot; Chef Musabbeh said as he prepared the dish. &quot;I will put the rice in now. I’ll put some spices in as well. So now, I’m going to put it on a plate, and I’m going to garnish it&quot; But, before eating, everyone said Bismillā, which means in the name of Allah. Chef Musabbeh then prepared his second dish the famous Emirati ouzi with oriental rice, a lamb dish with cinnamon and cardamom. You can make the dish yourself by following the recipe below: Chef Musabbehs Ouzi and Oriental Rice Recipe Ingredients: 1100g lamb shank 500g of basmati rice 100g of minced lamb 2 bay leaves 3 cinnamon sticks 10g of garlic - freshly chopped 120g of onion - freshly chopped 100g of tomato - freshly chopped 20g of ghee butter Salt and pepper 6.5ml of water 10g of tamarind powder 40g of Emirati spices 30g of tomato paste 40g of coriander - freshly chopped Instructions: 1.

Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served .

Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc></programme>

One of the best ways to admire the architecture around Dubai Marina is from the deck of a boat. You can charter a private yacht, hop onboard an organised boat tour - or you can even cross the marina for as little as €2 in a water taxi. Five-star resorts hug the coastline. Their vast, marble-clad lobbies lead to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunch venues and postcard-perfect beaches. As for Dubai Marinas beach clubs, from Drift to Zero Gravity , they are dizzyingly beautiful; their pool decks are catwalks for the latest swimwear fashions. Jumereirah Beach Residence Jumeirah Beach Residence itself is the largest single-phase commercial and residential project in the world. Its strategically lined along a chic waterfront strip known as The Walk , feautring stunning 3D murals. The Walk has a very varied range of fashion, home and handicraft shops and boutiques.

Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148. Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door, The Dubai Mall houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and Dubai Mall’s indoor ice rink is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest VR Park in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes.

Fitness expert and Youtube star Lilly Sabri @lillysabri says the walking is an ideal complement to a regular routine. “I think that when you’re on a holiday you want to make memories as well… so trying different things,” she says. “So, if you’re someone goes to the gym wherever you normally train and in whatever country that might be, it might be nice to try something different. So, getting outside. You certainly couldn’t do this in London where I’m originally from. So, it’s keeping fit and healthy but in a different way.” Wellness tourism has evolved to become the travel industry’s fastest growing sector – something Dubai is continuing to expand upon and develop. Across town amongst the shimmering Jumeirah Lakes Towers you will find the SMSF Heartfulness Meditation Centre. It’s the only one of its kind in the MENA region and they hold daily meditation classes that attract up to 500 people. “I think we just forgot where... we’ve been so focused on external gratification... now people are actually zoning in and they realise what’s important on how we feel and how we can impact on those around us,” says fitness expert Christian Williams. “This place in Dubai is not just where people live, it’s a stop off where people go on vacation. So, what we’re doing here in Heartfulness Meditation is just incredible not just for people living here but anyone who is willing to come and travel. And I can just see us moving forwards and I’m just so pleased I came to this centre because it’s free and it’s on every single week.” “Dubai is gr</desc></programme>

In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep - took off in one from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring. “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.” Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.” Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc></programme>

Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash. If you think you have a samurai spirit, this should feel like home.</desc></programme>

There arent many meals that can claim royal lineage dating back almost a thousand years to the ancient emperors of China. Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc></programme>

Four months prior, in June of 2019, Tim Carnahan was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, Brain Cancer. According to Tim&apos;s medical team, his life expectancy could be between three months and 18 months. Fast forward to now, 2020; today&apos;s update is one we hoped would never come. With a heavy heart and tear-filled eyes, we share with you that Tim Carnahan has passed away after battling for close to 12 months. It only fits that the last words to pass his lips were I love you, Lory, and keep fishing. While his time on earth was cut short, the amount of joy he experienced and shared with others was genuinely tremendous and will never be forgotten. If you would like to help out in any way, lory and friends have put together a Go Fund Me page to ease the financial burden of medical bills and afford lory some time to greave and transition into life without Tim. We love you, Tim. Rest in peace, buddy.</desc></programme>

Using his in with sexy trash TV personality Asia Buchanan (Anju McIntyre) as leverage he persuades small time cable mogul Otto Van Sant to give him one last chance to redeem himself. Claiming a secret source in the backwoods of Pennsylvania, Mickey and Asia, along with technical crew Jerome Curly Baker, Drew Simmons, production manager Pauline Stark and able assistant Billie Mulligan set off to find and exploit the Muckie Mystery. They re met in the middle of nowhere by Cletus Hobbs, Mickey s secret source, who leads them to the cabin which will be their home base for the production. After a disastrous first night Cletus meets them in the morning accompanied by his cretinous cousins Horace and Elmer, who take the gang to their Muckman Mooseum on the edge of a nearby swamp. Various Muckman artifacts, including a Muckman skull under glass, are on display. More convincing is the unearthly howl the crew hears outside the museum. Giving chase, the gang sees a hirsute figure fleeing through the woods (leaving behind the unbearable stench characteristic of Muckman), capturing a glimpse of the creature on tape. That night they get an even better look at the monster when it attacks their cabin, and the following evening when the crew attempts to document the capture of the creature in a trap set by Cletus and his boys all hell breaks loose. The creature appears big as life. Chaos ensues, there is blood and dismemberment, but all is not as it seems. Cletus and his gang have their own agenda, as do Mickey and Asia, and even Billie knows more than she lets on. In the end there are more things loose in the woods than anyone suspects, and the swamps unleash a few secrets as well.</desc></programme>

The city is still c&quot;&amp;&quot;onfined within its walls, and has a population of just under 300, but it is contiguous with the town of Rabat, which takes its name from the Arabic word for suburb, and has a population of over 11,000 (as of March 2014). The city was founded as Maleth in &quot;&amp;&quot;around the 8th century BC by Phoenician settlers, and was later renamed Melite by the Romans. Ancient Melite was larger than present-day Mdina, and it was reduced to its present size during the Byzantine or Arab occupation of Malta. During the latter peri&quot;&amp;&quot;od, the city adopted its present name, which derives from the Arabic word medina. The city remained the capital of Malta throughout the Middle Ages, until the arrival of the Order of St. John in 1530, when Birgu became the administrative centre of the isl&quot;&amp;&quot;and. Mdina experienced a period of decline over the following centuries, although it saw a revival in the early 18th century. At this point, it acquired several Baroque features, although it did not lose its medieval character.Mdina remained the centre of&quot;&amp;&quot; the Maltese nobility and religious authorities, but it never regained its pre-1530 importance, giving rise to the popular nickname the &quot;&quot;Silent City&quot;&quot; by both locals and visitors. Mdina is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and it is n&quot;&amp;&quot;ow one of the main tourist attractions in Malta. Today, Mdina is one of Malta&apos;s major tourist attractions, hosting about 750,000 tourists a year. No cars are allowed in Mdina, partly why it has earned the nickname &apos;the Silent City&apos;. The city displays an u&quot;&amp;&quot;nusual mix of Norman and Baroque architecture, including several palaces, most of which serve as private homes.An extensive restoration of the city walls was undertaken between 2008 and 2016.</desc></programme>

She is a Bharatnatyam dancer and cooks a meaner batch of fries than Chai Raja dancing bharatnatyam while she cooks so good that not only Chai Rajas clientele is wooed away, but so is Basha!

The granny gobbles up just about anything in sight and the trays barely make it out of the kitchen to the customers. Sundar almost catches her red-handed and when questioned by Chai Raja for the missing snacks blames her- in return he gets a sound thwack on his head as a furious Chai Raja points at his granny who beams wide- she is toothless! How can she eat without teeth! Demands Chai Raja. Sundar too is perplexed and so is Basha who too is annoyed to find his normal share of fritters missing. Basha and he team up to corner the artful granny. They soon discover that she has a hidden pair of dentures that she uses conveniently to chew down the chow. With Bashas help, Sundar manages to snatch away the dentures and the shop erupts in chaos as the granny proves that she too has quite a killer aim with plates! She retrieves the dentures and is about to chomp down in triumph when Chai Raja happens on her. But all the sweet-natured Chai Raja does is pack some extra fritters for her as she bids him a goodbye while an exasperated Sundar chases Basha from again raiding the shelves.</desc></programme>

And not just Nino, the twins too have fun seeing their planes fly so well. But no matter how much Mewmew tries it doesn’t fly like the planes of the others. Mewmew wishes her planes flew too so she asks Deedee to work some magic for her. So Deedee casts an ‘all day flying’ spell onto Mewmew’s plane but Nino comes in-between and gets hit by the spell on his helmet. Now Nino can’t stop flying and zooms away all over Abra-Dabra. He flies so wildly that he send Mayor De Pfeffle for a spin after knocking over his flower display. Nino is sorry for being so carried away that he tries to land, but to his surprise the helmet keeps pulling him skyward. Charlie tries weighing Nino down with his heavy mail bag, but the helmet is too strong for even Charlie to grab a hold of that Nino is flung away higher and farther. Nino promises to deliver the mail, much to the happiness of Charlie who can get a much deserved nap for all the effort. So begins Abra-Dabra’s very own first ‘air’-mail courtesy of Nino. Deedee comes up with a plan to help the ‘jet-lagged’ Nino after being inspired by the paper planes Mewmew makes. She shouts out to Nino to use a long sheet of paper from the mail bag and make a plane ‘Mewmew style’ with the wings pointing downwards. The plan works and Nino is able to fly right into Mewmew’s house and the magic wears-off as the sun sets in Abra-Dabra. In all the fuss Mewmew understands what made her planes not to fly, which actually helped Nino come down, and makes her paper planes fly so well now, thanks to Deedee.</desc></programme>

Oops! Quickly putting Sundar in charge, Chai Raja hops on his rusty cycle and heads off for fresh stock. Meanwhile, Sundar sees the customers line up and for the sake of Chai Raja wants to somehow keep them happy. Sundar sees Basha snacking on his private banana reserve and sprinting over strikes a deal with Basha- give me your bananas for now, and I will let you snack. Basha, after a moments thought agrees and the deal is struck. As Basha in an odd moment of generosity, entertains the customers, Sundar frantically hashes up fritters- but when Basha shows up for his share, Sundarsidelines him and serves the customers. When this happens more than twice, Basha loses his nice-guy face and decides to set things straight. The customers find their plates vanishing and their teas arriving in curious ways. Sundar tries to iron things out, but Basha is in a frenzy. Soon when Chai Raja arrives triumphantly hoisting fresh bananas, he is literally stampeded by the fleeing customers. Sundar stands sheepish as not far away Basha chuckles holding a pile of banana fritters. He bites into one and chews...but then in disgust spits it out; after all Sundar cant cook like Chai Raja.

The answer seems to lie in Deedee’s magic spell that makes one purple custard jar never run out of purple custard for the entire day. And it works like a charm, non-stop purple custard. The Mayor gets a half eaten jar of purple custard and keeps it safe for after, only to have it finished by the Doobydoos. As the Mayor turns up at Tiggy’s once more for more purple custard, he rushes off with the jar that the spell has been cast on. A happy Mayor gets Mewmew to stay guard of the jar while he is out, and Mewmew catches the Doobydoos red handed trying to eat the custard. But the jar tips over in the confusion and unknown to Mewmew the loyal custard guard, the bottle keeps on flowing till it reaches the ground floor. Deedee is called in urgency and only Nino can fly up the building and put the jar right up again. Having done that they call all the townsfolk to come to town hall to eat up as much purple custard as they can. All join in and have a hearty treat, so much so that they cannot have a bite more. Finally Mayor De Pfeffle arrives and is happy to share his purple custard with everyone, but much to his surprise no one wants any. Wonder why?</desc></programme>

Boris got one too, but he doesn’t want his to get dirty at all. So he decides not to use it at all even though he misses all the fun Sandy is having. Mewmew and Sandy even have a race across town. Boris even declines a chance to race, but is entirely sceptical about it as he doesn’t even want a splash of mud to fall on it. He is even more worried when he sees Sandy’s car not working. Deedee tries to help by magically trying to create a bubble guard around Boris’s car, but the spell falls on Sandy’s car instead. Now no one can even touch the car, let alone repair it. Boris vouches to allow Sandy use his car as he acknowledges that it was his undoing that led to the creation of the bubble in the first place. Sandy is overjoyed and promises to be extra careful. So careful that Mewmew can even beat her by running on his ears. Deedee tells Boris to prove to Sandy that she can use the car faster, so Boris races with Mewmew and accidentally splashes mud over his face, but then is happy he does and enjoys the fun. He races so fast that he pops the bubble guard over Sandy’s car by crashing into it.

So she continues walking forward in reverse mode. She is so engrossed in her new walking mode that she bumps into Deedee making her books fall all over the place. On Deedee’s query as to what new learning Bella was into, they start discussing about Tika Pila and their joined curiosity to know more about the secretive creature by asking everybody in Abra-Dabra what they know about Tika Pila. Charlie seems to know a little, but the Doobydoos are too scared to even speak about her. But Bella is determined to know all she can about Tika Pila and sets off all geared for the expedition. She is scared out of her wits by the sudden and loud hooting of Tika Pila she runs for her life and slips to a halt right in front of Deedee and Nino. Almost when Bella is about to give up her Tika Pila discovery project, Deedee encourages her by helping Bella with some magic. Deedee casts a spell to help Bella get close enough to study Tika Pila. Strengthened by the spell, Bella gives one more try. Deedee and friends soon spot Tika Pila at town-hall. But as they admire how wonderful Tika Pila looks as she eats cacti flowers they hear her hoot very differently. Bella opines that the hoots are successively different because Tika Pila wants to go back home. Just then the Doodbydoos pass by and Tika Pila follows them. Deedee comes up with a plan to lure Tika Pila back to her home by getting the Doobydoos to follow Mayor De Pfeffle holding out a plate stacked with their favourite custard sandwiches. Deedee and Bella lay cacti flowers as well for Tika Pila to follow. On seeing the wide open cacti fields Tika Pila gives a loud and happy toot and makes a run for it. Bella is so happy that she decides that something as wonderful, mystical and magical as Tika Pila shouldn’t be studied.</desc></programme>

Boris even declines a chance to race, but is entirely sceptical about it as he doesn’t even want a splash of mud to fall on it. He is even more worried when he sees Sandy’s car not working. Deedee tries to help by magically trying to create a bubble guard around Boris’s car, but the spell falls on Sandy’s car instead. Now no one can even touch the car, let alone repair it. Boris vouches to allow Sandy use his car as he acknowledges that it was his undoing that led to the creation of the bubble in the first place. Sandy is overjoyed and promises to be extra careful. So careful that Mewmew can even beat her by running on his ears. Deedee tells Boris to prove to Sandy that she can use the car faster, so Boris races with Mewmew and accidentally splashes mud over his face, but then is happy he does and enjoys the fun. He races so fast that he pops the bubble guard over Sandy’s car by crashing into it.

Deedee and Nino devise a plan and Nino keeps Mewmew happy and practising while Deedee rounds up the townsfolk to attend the concert. Charlie goes to get the twins, but takes a quick nap instead. Though all take a while to come, Deedee and Nino lift Mewmew’s spirits so high that the entire town come rushing to the concert on hearing the joyful music Mewmew is playing.

So Deedee comes up with a non-magic way to help. Happy at what Deedee suggests, Tommy decides to enroll. The fabulous prize is Tiggy’s very own specially made jelly. The winner is decided by who gets the highest ovation as measured on the clap-o-meter. Charlie and the twins perform outstandingly, so does Mewmew the juggling rabbit, Luciano’s opera all of whom get loud ovations. Finally it is Tommy prickles turn, but he isn’t able to keep his eyes closed like Deedee suggested him to, making his singing come to an abrupt stop. Deedee asks the audience if they could close their eyes to help Tommy sing. That was all Tommy needed to sing so very melodiously.

Deedee and Nino agree to help. They soon invite all of Abra-Dabra, but Tommy Prickles isn’t so keen on attending, because he feels so very shy. But as Deedee doesn’t have any spell to make Tommy’s shyness go away she improvises without magic by making Tommy believe that she has cast a spell on Tommy’s hat. Tommy agrees to attend the party in the guise that the hat he is wearing is now a chatter hat that will help him talk to others at the party. Nino is confused as he’s happy on one side that magic wasn’t used but sad that Tommy thinks magic is used. Tommy Prickles fits right in at the party and has fun playing with the Doobydoos and talks so freely and happily with everyone. Just then a huge gust of wind ruffles everything including Tommy’s hat. Poor sad Tommy feels so shy and helpless that he wants to go back home. But Deedee implores him to stay by trying to make him hopeful that Nino would return soon with Tommy’s hat. Tommy slumps on the ground and won’t budge, not until Deedee gets Tommy to don Tiggy’s baker hat. Tommy jumps springs back up and rounds all the party goers to teach them his very own special Wiggly Worm dance. Just then as they all dance in a bee-line behind Tommy, Nino flies in with Tommy’s hat. A confused Tommy discovers that he was wearing Tiggy’s hat till then and is flabbergasted to know that Deedee didn’t work any magic into the hat all along. Tommy Prickles runs away crying. Tommy reasons with Deedee that all of Abra-Dabra will think of him as silly, but Deedee tells him that if he couldn’t believe her, then to at least believe those who love having him along. Tommy looks up to see all his friends walking up to him doing the Wiggly Worm dance. Tommy takes a brave step and listens to his friends wanting have him back. He joins them just the way he is, without his ‘magic’ hat. Deedee finally agrees with Nino that sometimes no magic is good.</desc></programme>

Deedee is sad her spell went cuckoo on Nino, but Nino can’t stand her magic any more, so she checks out a remedy in her magic book and finds that the spell would cancel itself with three chimes of the town hall bell. Deedee decides to get Nino to the spot at the earliest. Nino scares the Doobydoos in his new ‘form’, but soon gets them to play along as he removes his helmet and is completely invisible now. Nino loves the fact that he is invisible and plays tricks on sleepy Charlie. Deedee sees the Doobydoos playing with the helmet and think they are throwing Nino about. But when she realizes that Nino isn’t in it, she is even more worried as the spell can become permanent if it isn’t cancelled soon. Nino has lots of fun playing pranks on Tiggy, Deedee, Charlie and Mewmew. Nino soon realizes that his pranks have gone out of hand that Mayor De Pfeffle announces over the loudspeaker to get Nino to come to them. Nino appears and is stubborn to stay invisible, so Deedee catches Nino with her hat and gets him in place to take full effect of the town hall chimes. Having regained his visibility, Nino agrees that a little magic is fun.</desc></programme>

Mewmew wishes her planes flew too so she asks Deedee to work some magic for her. So Deedee casts an ‘all day flying’ spell onto Mewmew’s plane but Nino comes in-between and gets hit by the spell on his helmet. Now Nino can’t stop flying and zooms away all over Abra-Dabra. He flies so wildly that he send Mayor De Pfeffle for a spin after knocking over his flower display. Nino is sorry for being so carried away that he tries to land, but to his surprise the helmet keeps pulling him skyward. Charlie tries weighing Nino down with his heavy mail bag, but the helmet is too strong for even Charlie to grab a hold of that Nino is flung away higher and farther. Nino promises to deliver the mail, much to the happiness of Charlie who can get a much deserved nap for all the effort. So begins Abra-Dabra’s very own first ‘air’-mail courtesy of Nino. Deedee comes up with a plan to help the ‘jet-lagged’ Nino after being inspired by the paper planes Mewmew makes. She shouts out to Nino to use a long sheet of paper from the mail bag and make a plane ‘Mewmew style’ with the wings pointing downwards. The plan works and Nino is able to fly right into Mewmew’s house and the magic wears-off as the sun sets in Abra-Dabra. In all the fuss Mewmew understands what made her planes not to fly, which actually helped Nino come down, and makes her paper planes fly so well now, thanks to Deedee.</desc></programme>

Deedee and Nino agree to help. They soon invite all of Abra-Dabra, but Tommy Prickles isn’t so keen on attending, because he feels so very shy. But as Deedee doesn’t have any spell to make Tommy’s shyness go away she improvises without magic by making Tommy believe that she has cast a spell on Tommy’s hat. Tommy agrees to attend the party in the guise that the hat he is wearing is now a chatter hat that will help him talk to others at the party. Nino is confused as he’s happy on one side that magic wasn’t used but sad that Tommy thinks magic is used. Tommy Prickles fits right in at the party and has fun playing with the Doobydoos and talks so freely and happily with everyone. Just then a huge gust of wind ruffles everything including Tommy’s hat. Poor sad Tommy feels so shy and helpless that he wants to go back home. But Deedee implores him to stay by trying to make him hopeful that Nino would return soon with Tommy’s hat. Tommy slumps on the ground and won’t budge, not until Deedee gets Tommy to don Tiggy’s baker hat. Tommy jumps springs back up and rounds all the party goers to teach them his very own special Wiggly Worm dance. Just then as they all dance in a bee-line behind Tommy, Nino flies in with Tommy’s hat. A confused Tommy discovers that he was wearing Tiggy’s hat till then and is flabbergasted to know that Deedee didn’t work any magic into the hat all along. Tommy Prickles runs away crying. Tommy reasons with Deedee that all of Abra-Dabra will think of him as silly, but Deedee tells him that if he couldn’t believe her, then to at least believe those who love having him along. Tommy looks up to see all his friends walking up to him doing the Wiggly Worm dance. Tommy takes a brave step and listens to his friends wanting have him back. He joins them just the way he is, without his ‘magic’ hat. Deedee finally agrees with Nino that sometimes no magic is good.</desc></programme>

Charlie seems to know a little, but the Doobydoos are too scared to even speak about her. But Bella is determined to know all she can about Tika Pila and sets off all geared for the expedition. She is scared out of her wits by the sudden and loud hooting of Tika Pila she runs for her life and slips to a halt right in front of Deedee and Nino. Almost when Bella is about to give up her Tika Pila discovery project, Deedee encourages her by helping Bella with some magic. Deedee casts a spell to help Bella get close enough to study Tika Pila.

Boris and Sandy set out to decorate Uncle Charlie’s house, just in time for their friends coming in with all the goodies for the party. They even invent a balloon jousting game between Deedee and Mewmew that makes Mewmew crash into Tiggy’s cake and thereby wreck all the arrangements much to the dismay of the twins.

But Mayor De Pfeffle cannot seem to understand what happened to his purple custard freshly sent over by Nino. So Mewmew offers to help while taking eggs over to Tiggy’s. But the carton turns out to only have one egg, and Tiggy needs to make eight more jars of purple custard. The answer seems to lie in Deedee’s magic spell that makes one purple custard jar never run out of purple custard for the entire day. And it works like a charm, non-stop purple custard. The Mayor gets a half eaten jar of purple custard and keeps it safe for after, only to have it finished by the Doobydoos. As the Mayor turns up at Tiggy’s once more for more purple custard, he rushes off with the jar that the spell has been cast on. A happy Mayor gets Mewmew to stay guard of the jar while he is out, and Mewmew catches the Doobydoos red handed trying to eat the custard. But the jar tips over in the confusion and unknown to Mewmew the loyal custard guard, the bottle keeps on flowing till it reaches the ground floor. Deedee is called in urgency and only Nino can fly up the building and put the jar right up again. Having done that they call all the townsfolk to come to town hall to eat up as much purple custard as they can. All join in and have a hearty treat, so much so that they cannot have a bite more. Finally Mayor De Pfeffle arrives and is happy to share his purple custard with everyone, but much to his surprise no one wants any. Wonder why?</desc></programme>

After getting a hint from Charlie on how much he loves chess, boris and sandy plan the birthday party around a ‘knights and castles’ theme. The twins get Deedee to bring balloons, a castle cake with turrets from Tiggy and a jousting dance from Mewmew. Boris and Sandy set out to decorate Uncle Charlie’s house, just in time for their friends coming in with all the goodies for the party. They even invent a balloon jousting game between Deedee and Mewmew that makes Mewmew crash into Tiggy’s cake and thereby wreck all the arrangements much to the dismay of the twins. This calls for Deedee’s magic where all the party ingredients are put into a large purple cauldron and it makes a gigantic bouncing castle in the chequerboard garden. And the snoring sounds lead them to find Uncle Charlie napping right inside it. They bounce around Uncle Charlie as much as they can and then wind down for a long snooze.

Seems Deedee’s magic is the only answer. The spell she conjures makes Tiggy be totally decided on the recipe that he sees first. And when the spell is cast, the recipe book opens up exactly at the recipe of a pie made of Tika Pila flowers. The problem is that only the Doobydoos can pick the Tika Pila flowers as it grows in the most prickly cacti in Abra-Dabra! But no matter how much Deedee and Nino coax Tiggy to work on another recipe; Tiggy is totally fixated on the Tika Pila flower pie. Though the Doobydoos love eating the flowers, they are too scared of the loud and angry Tika Pila monster that guards them and rush off in a hurry. They finally hit a bargain with Tiggy in exchange for a hundred custard sandwiches. Only with much reassuring and coaxing they pick every Tika Pila flower around. Mayor De Pfeffel is already at Tiggy’s and really hungry. But one Doobydoo is too ambitious and stays back to pick the last Tika Pila flower, but that awakes the Tika Pila monster and he shouts the biggest shout ever, scaring Tiggy and making the pie fly up high and splatter down on his face! The inevitable terrible has happened and there is nothing to give the Mayor. Just then when things couldn’t get any worse Mayor De Pfeffel lunges inside and is happy to see a whole plate of his favourite custard sandwiches.</desc></programme>
